## Project Summary

We are recommissioning a hypersonic research facility at ANU. The T2 shock tunnel facility is old, and manually
controlled. This project involves designing and implementing an automated gas filling system for the T2 shock
tunnel that monitors and performs filling of the various chambers of the facility with gas at specified conditions,
while checking for malfunctions such as leaks and preventing operations from being performed in the wrong
order. This system will be controlled by an ARM-based linux board. The project involves electronic design and
embedded system programming, as well as safety engineering. The output should be a set of open-source codes,
hardware and documentation for a user-friendly interface for this facility.
